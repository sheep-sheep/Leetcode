Backtracking is a way to solve computational problems, wwhich incremently build candiates and abandon partial candidate(from wiki).
I will analyze the core idea of each case and why it belongs to backtracking problem.

1. Print out all permutations of a list
  1) it needs to find sub permutations given one position/number
  2) as long as we do a swap, it's a valid case for partial solution(a permutation)
