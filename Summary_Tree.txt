1. Find the max depth of a Tree.
2. Determine if a tree is balanced.
  1) my first approach is to create a helper method to get the height.
  2) however, i got stuck on the 2nd step about how to use my helper to get the result.
  3) I should refer to the basic definition and do the check to use both methods.
  We do this for each node in the tree, so the overall complexity of isBalanced will be O(N^2).
  This is a top down approach.
 Â   def depth(depth, root):
      if root:
          return max(depth(depth+1, root.left), depth(depth+1, root.right))
      return depth
